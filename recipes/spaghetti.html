    <h3>How to Make Spaghetti</h3>

    <p>Spaghetti is an easy dish and staple of many household menus. It is cheap to make, and filling, so you can feed an entire family for less. This is essential these days.</p>
    
    <p>You can also tweak and modify the recipe to make it your own! Add veggies, cheese, or different protein choices as you see fit!</p>

        <li>Pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Protein (Ground beef or sausage)</li>
        <li>Cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. While the water is heating up, begin to brown your meet in a skillet.</li>
        <li>Once the water has come to a full boil, add your pasta to it, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking.</li>
        <li>After the meat has fully cooked, drain the meat and return it to the pan.</li>
